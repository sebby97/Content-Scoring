[{"content":"‚ú®BACK TO WORK AND A BIT UNSTEADY‚ú®\n\nSome of you have inquired and asked where I've been for the past few weeks and I wanted to take a moment to explain my absence. \n\nMy family and I lost my beautiful mother on April 4th to breast cancer.  She fought hard over the years, but in the end went peacefully          \nWe are doing our best to get back to some semblance of a routine but our hearts continue to hurt from our deep loss. \n\nAs we try to heal, I want to thank my PIX11 family, friends and relatives for their constant strength, hugs and words of comfort. No FB post can sum up how I feel about your kind gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nTo the survivors of breast cancer and the many women continuing to fight metastatic breast cancer, please know I pray for you daily.  I never spoke of my mother's fight publicly because she was an extremely private woman, but I know today she would want me to do what I can to raise even more awareness about a disease that continues to take our moms, daughters and wives.  \n\nTo the amazingly strong caregivers- I've seen firsthand what cancer can do to the human spirit. I've seen what taking care of our loved ones can do to a family.  It's draining and breaks you down but you will do it without complaint because of love. Overwhelming love for your beautiful family. Please always know you are not alone and know that the gift of loving and caring for your loved one is the biggest blessing and comfort you can provide, though it often feels like you can't do anything right. \n\nPlease keep our family in your prayers \n\nInna Lillahi Wa Inna ilayhi raji'un\n\"Surely we belong to Allah and to Him we shall return\"","profileString":"facebook_page.269809493185157","postURL":"https://facebook.com/269809493185157/posts/781660445333390","avatar":"https://graph.facebook.com/269809493185157/picture","classification":{"engine":"aylien","language":"en","taxonomy":[{"score":"0.1939","links":[{"rel":"self","link":"https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6"}],"label":"Family & Parenting","id":"IAB6","confident":true},{"score":"0.1842","links":[{"rel":"self","link":"https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6-7"},{"rel":"parent","link":"https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB6"}],"label":"Pregnancy","id":"IAB6-7","confident":false}]},"postidString":"facebook_page.269809493185157_781660445333390","postMeta":{"inserted":"content-engine"},"timestamp":1493211395,"sharesRcvd":1,"likesRcvd":229,"source":"facebook_page","lastUpdateQuantum":4984136,"name":"Narmeen Choudhury","imageLarge":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/18158007_781660445333390_8454148071480179238_n.jpg?oh=b7c67bcfc731346ee04b5f531ea45343&oe=598C2AA2","objectID":"781660445333390","repliesRcvd":67,"image":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/18158007_781660445333390_8454148071480179238_n.jpg?oh=5b6f26eb72e1ebd9a4fba36e6ee6eb22&oe=5978EA5D","username":"NarmeenNews","link":"https://www.facebook.com/NarmeenNews/photos/a.453611474804957.1073741829.269809493185157/781660445333390/?type=3","timeQuantum":4977371,"type":"photo","title":"Timeline Photos"},{"content":"Filling in for the lovely @kaitytong this evening, so join me at 5p and 10p @pix11news","profileString":"facebook_page.269809493185157","postURL":"https://facebook.com/269809493185157/posts/786772841488817","avatar":"https://graph.facebook.com/269809493185157/picture","classification":{"engine":"aylien","language":"en","taxonomy":[{"score":"0.0807","confident":true,"links":[{"link":"https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB9","rel":"self"}],"id":"IAB9","label":"Hobbies & Interests"},{"score":"0.0563","confident":false,"links":[{"link":"https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB9-23","rel":"self"},{"link":"https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/classify/taxonomy/iab-qag/IAB9","rel":"parent"}],"id":"IAB9-23","label":"Photography"}]},"postidString":"facebook_page.269809493185157_786772841488817","postMeta":{"inserted":"content-engine"},"timestamp":1494102008,"sharesRcvd":2,"likesRcvd":185,"source":"facebook_page","lastUpdateQuantum":4984136,"name":"Narmeen Choudhury","imageLarge":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/18199547_786772841488817_2820497574054374378_n.jpg?oh=d8abcee967cfcd00f063a44112e029d1&oe=5979B274","objectID":"786772841488817","repliesRcvd":13,"image":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/18199547_786772841488817_2820497574054374378_n.jpg?oh=2fca99c76ac32653e9d905748eb37f23&oe=5988C98B","username":"NarmeenNews","link":"https://www.facebook.com/NarmeenNews/photos/a.453611474804957.1073741829.269809493185157/786772841488817/?type=3","timeQuantum":4980340,"title":"Timeline Photos","type":"photo"},{"content":"So this happened today as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos spoke as commencement speaker.
