Sometimes you feel like Alice in Wonderland falling down the rabbit hole.  \n\nFriends and family might tell you, get over it.  They might say, just move on with your life.  You might even want to.

Change or any loss DOES NOT make you a VICTIM.  \n\nIt just makes us STUCK.  Stuck in our mind and heart as we processes disappointments, loss of job or even a loved one.
